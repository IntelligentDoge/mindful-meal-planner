# Mindful Meal Planner

## Description

Mindful Meal Planner is a web application designed to help users plan their meals for the week with a focus on reducing food waste, promoting healthy eating habits, and staying within a budget.

Users can input their dietary restrictions, preferred cuisines, budget, and the amount of food they have on hand. The application then generates a personalized meal plan with recipes, shopping lists optimized to use existing ingredients, and options for adjusting serving sizes to minimize leftovers.

It emphasizes visually appealing recipe cards, drag-and-drop meal planning, and gamified tracking of food waste reduction to encourage sustained engagement.
