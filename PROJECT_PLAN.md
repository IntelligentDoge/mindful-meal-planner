## Mindful Meal Planner - Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the "Mindful Meal Planner" web application. It covers the architecture, key files, dependencies, implementation steps, and UI/UX design principles.

**1. Overall Architecture**

We will adopt a modular, three-tier architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

*   **Presentation Tier (Frontend):** This layer handles user interaction, displaying information, and capturing user input. It will be built using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
*   **Application Tier (Backend/API):** This layer acts as the intermediary between the frontend and the data tier. It handles business logic, data processing, user authentication, and generates meal plans based on user input.  We'll use Node.js with Express.js for the API.
*   **Data Tier (Database):** This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data, including user profiles, recipes, dietary restrictions, budgets, and shopping lists.  We'll use MongoDB as a NoSQL database for its flexibility and scalability, well-suited for handling diverse recipe data.

 +-----------------------+       +-----------------------+       +-----------------------+
 |  Presentation Tier   |  <--->  |   Application Tier    |  <--->  |      Data Tier       |
 |  (Frontend - React)  |       |  (Backend - Node/Express)|       |   (Database - MongoDB) |
 |   - User Interface   |       |   - API Endpoints     |       |   - Data Storage      |
 |   - User Input       |       |   - Business Logic    |       |   - Data Retrieval    |
 +-----------------------+       +-----------------------+       +-----------------------+
```

**2. Key Files to be Created**

**Data Tier (MongoDB):**

*   This tier doesn't involve creating files directly but focuses on defining database schemas within the backend `models` directory (as mentioned above).  We'll need to design schemas for:
    *   `User`:  Stores user information, dietary restrictions, budget, and other preferences.
    *   `Recipe`: Stores recipe details, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.
    *   `MealPlan`: Stores the generated meal plan for a user for a given week.
    *   `ShoppingList`: Stores the generated shopping list based on the meal plan.

**3. Dependencies Needed**

**Frontend (React):**

*   `react`: Core React library.
*   `react-dom`:  For rendering React components in the browser.
*   `react-router-dom`: For client-side routing and navigation.
*   `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   `styled-components` or `Material-UI` or `Chakra-UI`:  For styling components (choose one). `styled-components` offers CSS-in-JS, `Material-UI` provides a pre-built component library, and `Chakra-UI` provides accessible, reusable building blocks.
*   `react-beautiful-dnd`: For drag-and-drop functionality for meal planning.

3.  **Backend Development:**
    *   Create the basic server structure (server.js, routes, controllers, models).
    *   Implement user authentication (registration, login, logout) using JWT and bcrypt.
    *   Develop API endpoints for recipe retrieval, creation, and updating.
    *   Implement the meal plan generation algorithm (`recipeAlgorithm.js`) based on user input and available recipes.
    *   Develop API endpoints for managing meal plans and shopping lists.
    *   Implement the waste reduction algorithm (`wasteReductionAlgorithm.js`).
    *   Write unit tests for backend functionality.

4.  **Frontend Development:**

    *   Perform integration testing to ensure that the frontend and backend work together correctly.
    *   Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback from real users.

6.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the backend to a suitable platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
    *   Deploy the frontend to a CDN or hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
    *   Configure the application to use the deployed backend API URL.

7.  **Post-Deployment:**
    *   Monitor application performance and stability.
    *   Address any bugs or issues reported by users.
    *   Implement new features and improvements based on user feedback.

**5. User Interface Design Principles to Follow**

*   **User-Centered Design:**  Prioritize the user's needs and goals throughout the design process. Conduct user research and usability testing to understand their behavior and preferences.
*   **Clean and Intuitive Layout:**  Use a clear and consistent layout that is easy to navigate. Group related elements together and use whitespace effectively. Avoid clutter and overwhelming the user with too much information.
*   **Visually Appealing Recipe Cards:**  Recipe cards should be visually engaging, featuring high-quality images of the food and clear, concise information.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Meal Planning:**  Make the meal planning process interactive and intuitive by using drag-and-drop functionality. This allows users to easily move recipes around and customize their meal plan.
*   **Gamified Waste Tracking:**  Incorporate gamification elements to encourage sustained engagement with food waste reduction.  Use progress bars, badges, rewards, and friendly competition to motivate users.
*   **Accessibility:** Design the application to be accessible to users with disabilities. Follow accessibility guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). Use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, and ensure sufficient color contrast.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Clear and Concise Language:** Use clear and concise language throughout the application. Avoid jargon or technical terms that users may not understand.
*   **Consistent Branding:** Maintain a consistent brand identity throughout the application. Use a consistent color palette, typography, and imagery.
*   **Feedback and Error Handling:** Provide users with clear feedback on their actions.  Display helpful error messages when something goes wrong.
*   **Mobile-First Approach:** Consider the mobile experience early in the design process, ensuring the app is fully functional and visually appealing on smaller screens.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** Offer both light and dark modes to cater to user preferences and reduce eye strain.

By following this comprehensive development plan, the Mindful Meal Planner can be built into a valuable tool that helps users eat healthier, reduce food waste, and save money. The emphasis on UI/UX ensures that the application is not only functional but also enjoyable and easy to use, promoting sustained engagement and positive habits.
